If you are looking to make a difference but can&#39;t make that commitment, volunteers can also write Relatable Role Model Letters. These are page-long letters to connect girls all over the place to inspiring and uplifting volunteers. Volunteers are asked to hand write at least five different letters and decorate them as they wish. Other volunteer tasks include administrative work, community outreach, big events, and fundraising events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo Courtesy of Girls Empowerment Network</em></p>",

Below, you will&nbsp;find a list of&nbsp;all&nbsp;the items you need to fill a zip-top bag to&nbsp;be dropped into the backpack of a child experiencing food insecurity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>STEP ONE</u>: &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identify a Title 1 School by performing an online search for the&nbsp;list of Title 1 schools in your county.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip:&nbsp;Choose&nbsp;one near&nbsp;the location where you will be assembling the snack bags for easy delivery.&nbsp;If you would like&nbsp;support selecting a Title 1 School, just reach out to us at team@happyly.com.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>STEP TWO</u>:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Verify that the school will be interested in receiving the snack bags on the date you plan to deliver them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip: Avoid calling the school during the windows of&nbsp;student arrival or departure times.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>STEP THREE</u>:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create an event on the Happyly app and invite colleagues to gather for this wonderful opportunity to help local kids in need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip: If this volunteer effort is not already sponsored by your company, create a Sign-Up Genius so individuals can select an item or items&nbsp;from the list to provide for the snack bags to spread out the cost. Once your management/executives&nbsp;see the connections and impact created by this event, they are likely to be eager to sponsor the next opportunity!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>STEP FOUR</u>:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Order/pickup the supplies. You can substitute items by preference, but the items listed below are proven to fit well in a gallon plastic freezer bag, and are of an acceptable weight for little ones to carry home easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Juice Box</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Fruit Cup</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">GoGo Squeeze Apple Sauce</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Kraft Easy Mac</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Goldfish Crackers</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Apple</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Noodle Soup/Ramen</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Granola Bar</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Gallon Plastic Freezer Bags</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip: We find Costco is a great place to pickup supplies, but you will be unable to get the precise amount of items based on the numbers that each of these items come in bulk. So either&nbsp;a second stop at a grocery or big box store for a few extras, or plan to have extra of certain items based on the number of kits you plan to compile. For example: Honest Juice Boxes come in packs of 40 at Costco so if you are planning to put together 50 Snackbags, you can either get 80 and put two in many of the bags, or get 40 and buy an extra box of ten at the grocery store. Alternatively, order online where there is greater variety of bulk sizes in one shopping cart.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>STEP FIVE</u>:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pickup notecards and colorful pens at an art supply&nbsp;or big box store. These will be used at a second giveback station where your team can&nbsp;write fun or encouraging notes to send with each snack bag.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip: Start with &quot;Dear Friend&quot; or &quot;Dear&nbsp;Student.&quot;&nbsp;Everyone&nbsp;loves a good joke&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;positive message. Quotes are also always encouraged!&nbsp;Letters can be signed with either your&nbsp;initial or first name but please do not include any personal info,&nbsp;religious references or projections of&nbsp;feelings (i.e. &quot;It&#39;s all going to be okay.&quot;)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>STEP SIX</strong></u><strong>:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create and Print Table Topics.&nbsp;Chat while you pack! Use these ideas, or ask a question of&nbsp;your own to get the conversation started.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Do you participate in giving back orvolunteering with any other organizations?<br />\r\nHow does donating your time and talent&nbsp;make you feel?<br />\r\nWould you like to volunteer more frequently this year?<br />\r\nHow do you spend your time outside of&nbsp;work, professionally or personally?</div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip: Pick up a few&nbsp;plastic sign stands&nbsp;at an office supply or big box store so you can have the Table Topics displayed&nbsp;(as well as the activity instructions for both snackbag assembly and notecards).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>STEP SEVEN</strong></u>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plan a mode of transport for the assembled snack bags to the school you have selected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip:&nbsp;Multiple large reusable fabric or tote bags work great depending on the size of the delivery.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>STEP EIGHT</strong></u>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once at your event location, set up two stations for card writing and snack bag assembly with appropriate signs displayed at each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complete a notecard, then simply open a zip-top bag, insert your card and add&nbsp;one of each item to it, and seal.&nbsp;Repeat, if time permits. So&nbsp;easy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip: Set up the stations in a way that encourages people to fill out their card first so you can make sure a card makes it in most/all bags. Verbally encourage people as well, if you are comfortable doing so.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>STEP NINE</u>:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deliver assembled snack bags to the Title 1 school you coordinated. Teachers or administrators can slip them into the&nbsp;bags of children who may be food compromised&nbsp;on Friday afternoons, so they will be guaranteed nourishment&nbsp;throughout the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip: Please try to avoid dropping them during student arrival or dismissal as the staff will be preoccupied.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><u>STEP TEN</u>:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any questions you might have before or after your event are welcome at&nbsp;team@happyly.com. We are happy to help and we would also be so thrilled to receive photos and/or testimonials following your event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happyly Pro Tip: Please send pictures&nbsp;so we can celebrate your team!!</em>&nbsp;Also, the&nbsp;<em>&quot;Apply to&nbsp;Giveback on your own&quot; button below will take you to the Happyly website, where you can&nbsp;learn more about our Giveback programming.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Happy Volunteering and thank you for pitching in to support&nbsp;kids in your community!!</strong></h2>",

    "content": "<p>According to The American Cancer Society website, &quot;Studies have found that cancer survivors with strong emotional support tend to adjust better to the changes cancer brings, have a more positive outlook, and often report a better quality of life. Research has shown that people with cancer need support from friends. You can make a big difference in the life of someone with cancer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notes and calls, visits and errands are all amazing ways to make an impact in the life of someone experiencing cancer. Lifting their spirit and showing them they are not alone are impactful ways to inspire elevated hope and endurance to face their challenges. Gifts and sharing projects you can accomplish together - this can be as simple as card games or puzzles, or as involved as coordinating a fundraiser for ACS together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people are concerned about saying the &quot;wrong thing&quot; when talking with friends who have cancer. The American Cancer Society provides pointers on their website to take the uncertainty out of it, and make sure it doesn&#39;t deter friends from showing up for those they care about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Many people worry that they don&rsquo;t know what to say to someone with cancer. Try to remember that the most important thing is not what you say &ndash; it&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re there and willing to listen. Try to hear and understand how your friend feels. Let them know that you&rsquo;re open to talking whenever they feel like it. Or, if the person doesn&rsquo;t feel like talking, let them know that&rsquo;s OK, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Listen without always feeling that you have to respond. Sometimes a caring listener is what the person needs most.</li>\r\n\t<li>Gear the conversation to your friend&rsquo;s attention span so they don&rsquo;t feel overwhelmed or guilty about not being able to talk.</li>\r\n\t<li>Help your friend focus on whatever brings out good feelings, such as sports, religion, travel, or pets.</li>\r\n\t<li>Help your friend keep active in the friendship by asking advice, opinions, and questions &ndash; even if you don&rsquo;t get the response you expect.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ask your friend if they&rsquo;re in any discomfort. Suggest new ways to be more comfortable, such as using more pillows or moving the furniture.</li>\r\n\t<li>Give honest compliments, such as &ldquo;You look rested today.&rdquo;</li>\r\n\t<li>Support your friend&rsquo;s feelings. Let them be negative, withdrawn, or silent. Resist the urge to change the subject.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t urge your friend to &ldquo;fight&rdquo; the disease.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t tell them how strong they are; they may feel the need to act strong even when they&rsquo;re sad or exhausted.</li>\r\n\t<li>Be sure to include your friend when talking to others in the room.</li>\r\n\t<li>Assume that your friend can hear you even if they seem to be asleep or dazed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t offer medical advice or your opinions on things like diet, vitamins, and herbal therapies.</li>\r\n\t<li>Respect their decisions about how their cancer care will be treated, even if you disagree.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t remind them of past behaviors that might be related to the illness, such as drinking or smoking.
